* 													CLASS 01_Batch
* 
* 
* 	In a situation where we generate reports, we might want to use messages in batch. We've starting this
* 	class discussing the subject and creating a new service, "service-reading-report", to generate this 
*	kind of report.
*	
*	Then, we will create a new service, that will be responsible for creating a reports in batch (imagine 
*	it as a service that will run monthly and generate reports for every single user we have in this DB).
