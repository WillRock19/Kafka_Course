* 												CLASS 01_Organization and e-mail services
* 
*	A. Reorganizing our project
*
*	 	Let's start this class refactoring our common-kafka, separating all the classes that works with the consumer and 
*		the ones that work with dispatchers in different packages.
* 
*		Then, let's talk about the e-mail service. Do we really need a service for that? Couldn't be just a library? Course
*		it could. The difficult whould be that the e-mail is an external system, and the way we'll communicate with it is 
*		important.
*
*
*	B. Discussing the e-mail service
*
*		Imagine that we've used the e-mail as a common library, as we're using the common-kafka. Now, I want to change the
*		way the e-mail is generated from using Azure to AWS. If the e-mail is just a library, every service that implements
*		it must migrate at same time BEFORE I can start use the new way, which creates a depedency between all the services
*		and the library.
*
*		That's a problem, a really bad one. Using a service, we can avoid that kind of problem, making the evolution of the
*		email something detached from the other services.
*
*		Still, there's something to consider: the way we're working right now, the e-mail text will be generated inside each
*		service that sends the message to the dispatcher. What if we wanted something greater? Or, thinking in another way:
*		what if we want to send an attachment in our e-mail? How could we deal with specific situations using something as
*		generic as the e-mail service?
*
*			Answer: we could create other, more specific services, to work as middle man in those situations and make the
*					specific configurations happen for us. Awesome, huh? The magic of microservices coming to life with
*					kafka.
*
*					To show this approach, we're going to create a little, tiny bit of program called service-email-new-order,
*					which will be responsible to create an e-mail that our service-new-order is currently creating by dispatching
*					the event in it's main.
*
*						Another advantage of this approach is that we're going to apply the Fast Delegate to the e-mail generation,
*						which is incredible!!!
